● Perfect! I've successfully fixed the factoranalysismachinelearningcommand. Here's a summary of what I mapped and fixed:

  Variable Mappings

  I mapped the scikit-learn variables to the classic factor analysis format:

  1. transformer.mean_ → eigen ("Feature Means" column)
  2. transformer.noise_variance_ → eigen_common ("Noise Variance" column)
  3. transformer.components_.T → loadings ("Components Factor 1/2" columns)
  4. Calculated pseudo-communalities from loadings → commonalities ("Pseudo Communalities" column)
  5. Calculated pseudo-uniquenesses (1 - communalities) → uniquenesses ("Pseudo Uniquenesses" column)

  Key Fixes Applied

  1. Variable Storage: Added proper DataFrame storage of sklearn results before the _display() call
  2. Table Headers: Updated column headers to reflect machine learning terminology:
    - "Eigenvalues" → "Feature Means"
    - "Common Factor Eigenvalues" → "Noise Variance"
    - "Commonalities" → "Pseudo Communalities"
    - "Uniquenesses" → "Pseudo Uniquenesses"
    - "Loadings" → "Components"
  3. Bug Fix: Fixed typo iiloc → iloc in the table creation
  4. Table Title: Changed title to "Factor analysis (Machine Learning)" to distinguish it from the classic version

  The table widget should now work properly with the machine learning command and display the sklearn results in a comparable format to the classic factor analysis, with appropriate column names that reflect the different     
  mathematical approach.
